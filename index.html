            <p>After first touching html and css I feel in love with the process of bringing static ideas to life, in my very first few weeks of learning html and css I actually created my very own Discord clone from scratch and although it was only a very static design with no real Discord functionality nor any JavaScript &#40; The link to the pages will be put below &#41; , I had fallen in love with the process of creating. After learning JavaScript I actually went back to the discord clone to see what I could add to improve it and I was amazed at what I could do with so little knowledge. While it was extremely hard I found myself enjoying the process of learning something new and applying it to something I had created, Iâ€™ve heard that this is a key skill for all software developers from the hundreds of videos I have watched.</p>

        <div class="center-text">
            <p>I have found myself truly engrossed in all things software development and have found myself in communities revolving around it. Problem solving is something I have loved doing especially while working on my projects and I feel like a large majority of Software Development is about solving issues and learning while applying that knowledge. I feel as though I have found something I really align with and from my research so far it appears as though it is a career path where there is a lot of potential for growth and progression which will give me the opportunity to work on many diverse projects.</p>

# showcase-page

Welcome to my showcase page! Here I have explained a little bit about myself, why I want to become a Software Developer
and showed a few of the projects I have been working on since I start learning JavaScript.

This was much simpler than creating my application game as all I need to do was follow the figma design I had created for myself
then get all of the information formatted. 

The hardest thing about created this showcase page was coding the "image toggler / image slide",
which I created by making a function that takes a number variable then change the image to the correspending
number value in my files. I plan to change this later and refractor my code as I am looking into a better method for doing this.
